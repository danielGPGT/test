# 🔧 **Shared Pool Logic Fix**

## **The Problem You Identified**

You were absolutely right! The system was incorrectly showing:

```
❌ BEFORE (WRONG):
Standard Double Room: 30 capacity
Standard Twin Room: 30 capacity  
Pool "dfg": 30 capacity
```

But what you actually have is:
```
✅ AFTER (CORRECT):
Standard Double Room: 0-30 capacity (shared)
Standard Twin Room: 0-30 capacity (shared)
Pool "dfg": 30 capacity (shared between both categories)
```

---

## **🎯 What We Fixed**

### **1. Shared Pool Capacity Logic**
- **Before**: Each category got its own capacity (30 + 30 = 60 total)
- **After**: Categories share the same pool capacity (30 total, shared)

### **2. Pool Calculation**
- **Before**: Summed all allocation quantities for the same pool
- **After**: Takes the maximum allocation quantity (since they represent the same physical inventory)

### **3. Visual Indicators**
- Added **"🔄 Shared Pool"** badge for categories that share pools
- Added **"⚠️ Shared with other categories"** warning
- Shows correct utilization percentages

## **🔧 How It Works Now**

### **Example: Shared Room Types**

```
Contract: "Summer 2025 - Hotel Block"
├── Allocation 1:
│   ├── Categories: ["Standard Double Room", "Standard Twin Room"]
│   ├── Quantity: 30
│   └── Pool ID: "summer-room-pool"
│
└── Result:
    ├── Pool "summer-room-pool": 30 total capacity
    ├── Standard Double Room: 0-30 capacity (shared)
    └── Standard Twin Room: 0-30 capacity (shared)
```

### **Booking Logic**
- Book 10 Double rooms → Pool has 20 available
- Book 5 Twin rooms → Pool has 15 available  
- **Total booked**: 15 rooms from 30 total pool capacity

## **🚀 Perfect for Your Use Case**

This now correctly represents:
- **30 rooms total** in the pool
- **Can be booked as Double OR Twin**
- **Shared capacity** between both room types
- **Real-time tracking** of total utilization

The system now properly handles shared allocation pools! 🎯
