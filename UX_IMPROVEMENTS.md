# UX Improvements: Page Consolidation

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Too many pages for inventory setup
- Hotels page
- Contracts page  
- Rates page
- Listings page (separate)

**Result:** Lots of context switching, hard to see relationships

## ✨ Solution: Master-Detail Layout

### New "Inventory Setup" Page

**Single page with 3 panels showing the hierarchy:**

```
Hotels → Contracts → Rates
(What)   (When)      (Price)
```

## 📐 Layout Design

### Left Panel: Hotels (30% width)
**Purpose:** Select which hotel you're working with

- Room types count badge

**Interaction:**

- Selected hotel highlighted with primary border
- Hover effects
- Scroll if many hotels

### Middle Panel: Contracts (40% width)
**Purpose:** Select which contract for the chosen hotel

**Shows:**
- Contract name
- Date range
- Base rate + currency
- Total rooms
- Fee badges (VAT, City Tax, Resort Fee)
- Edit/Delete buttons

**Interaction:**
- Click contract → Right panel updates with rates
- Selected contract highlighted
- Only shows contracts for selected hotel
- "No contracts" state with create button

### Right Panel: Rates (30% width)
**Purpose:** View/manage rates for the chosen contract

**Shows:**
- Room type

- Board type badge
- Rate amount (prominent)
- Currency

**Interaction:**

## 🎨 Visual Features

Hover: bg-accent (subtle)
```

### Information Density
- Star ratings: Visual ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Dates: Icons 📅
- Location: MapPin icon
- Badges: Color-coded pills
- Compact but readable

### Context Bar (Bottom)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Selected: Hotel Le Champs → May 2025 Block   │
│ 2 contracts • 8 rates configured             │
│                                              │
│ [View Hotel Details] [View Contract Details] │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Always shows what's selected + quick access to details

## 📊 Navigation Comparison
