# 🎯 **Unified Inventory System - Complete Architecture**

## **How Categories, Allocations, and Pools Work Together**

You were absolutely right to ask about categories! The system is more complex than I initially explained. Here's the complete flow:

---

## **📋 The Complete Flow**

### **1. INVENTORY ITEM** 
```
Grand Hotel Budapest (item_type: 'hotel')
```

### **2. CATEGORIES** (Room Types, Service Types, etc.)
```
- Deluxe Double Room (max_occupancy: 2, pricing_mode: 'per_occupancy')
- Standard Single Room (max_occupancy: 1, pricing_mode: 'per_occupancy')  
- Suite (max_occupancy: 4, pricing_mode: 'per_occupancy')
```

### **3. CONTRACT** (Supplier Agreement)
```
"Summer 2025 - DMC Hungary"
├── Supplier: DMC Hungary
├── Valid: 2025-06-01 to 2025-08-31
└── Allocations: [
    {
      category_ids: ["deluxe-double-id"],
      quantity: 30,
      allocation_pool_id: "summer-2025-dmc-hungary-double",
      label: "DMC Hungary Block"
    }
  ]
```

### **4. ALLOCATION POOL** (Capacity Management)
```
"summer-2025-dmc-hungary-double"
├── Total Capacity: 30 (from allocation)
├── Current Bookings: 0
├── Available Spots: 30
└── Status: healthy
```

### **5. RATES** (Selling Prices)
```
"Deluxe Double BB - Summer Rate"
├── Category: Deluxe Double Room
├── Pool: summer-2025-dmc-hungary-double  
├── Occupancy: Double
├── Board: Bed & Breakfast
├── Rate: €150
└── When booked → reduces pool availability
```

---

## **🔗 How They Connect**

### **Categories → Allocations → Pools → Rates**

1. **Categories** define what you're selling (room types, ticket types, etc.)
2. **Allocations** specify how many of each category you have from each supplier
3. **Pools** aggregate capacity across multiple allocations (same pool_id)
4. **Rates** link to categories and pools, reducing availability when booked

### **Real Example:**

```
Hotel: Grand Hotel Budapest
├── Categories:
│   ├── Deluxe Double Room
│   └── Standard Single Room
│
├── Contracts:
│   ├── DMC Hungary Contract
│   │   └── Allocation: 30 Deluxe Double → Pool "summer-dmc-double"
│   └── Bedbank Contract  
│       └── Allocation: 40 Deluxe Double → Pool "summer-bedbank-double"
│
├── Pools:
│   ├── summer-dmc-double (30 capacity)
│   └── summer-bedbank-double (40 capacity)
│
└── Rates:
    ├── DMC Deluxe Double BB → Pool "summer-dmc-double"
    └── Bedbank Deluxe Double BB → Pool "summer-bedbank-double"
```
