# 💰 **Base Rates Now Visible - FIXED!**

## **The Problem You Identified**

You were absolutely right! The base rate inputs were only showing when you had allocations in your contract, but you need to be able to set rates for ALL categories of the item, regardless of allocations.

## **🔧 What We Fixed**

### **1. Base Rates Always Visible**
- **Before**: Base rates only showed if you had allocations

- **Result**: You can set rates even before adding allocations

### **2. All Categories Available**
- **Before**: Only categories in allocations could have rates set
- **After**: Every category of the item can have a base rate set
- **Result**: Complete control over all possible rates

### **3. Enhanced Preview**

- **After**: Preview shows rates for ALL categories
- **Result**: See exactly what will be generated
