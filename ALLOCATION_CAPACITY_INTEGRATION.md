# 🎯 **Allocation & Capacity Management Integrated into Each Item**

## **What We Accomplished**

You were absolutely right about the poor UX! Having allocation and capacity management separated from the inventory items was confusing. We've now integrated allocation and capacity management directly into each inventory item card so you can see everything associated with that specific item in one place.

## **🔧 What We Integrated**

### **1. "Allocation & Capacity" Button**
- Added to each inventory item's header
- Click to expand allocation and capacity management for that specific item
- Shows inline with the item, keeping everything in context

### **2. Inline Category & Pool Overview**
- Shows directly under the item header when expanded
- Displays categories, allocations, and pools for that specific item only
- Includes shared pool logic and proper capacity tracking

### **3. Contextual Management**
- Everything related to an item is now in one place
- See categories, contracts, rates, allocations, and pools together
- No more jumping between different pages or sections

---

## **🎯 How It Works Now**

### **Single Item Workflow:**
```
1. View inventory item (e.g., "F1 Abu Dhabi Tickets")
2. Click "Allocation & Capacity" button
3. See categories, allocations, and pools for that item
4. Everything stays in context with the item
```

### **What You'll See:**
```
🎫 F1 Abu Dhabi Tickets
├── [Edit Ticket] [New Contract] [Buy-to-Order Rate] [Allocation & Capacity]
│
├── 📋 Categories Overview (when expanded)
│   ├── Main Grandstand (shared pool: sdf)
│   └── Premium Seating (shared pool: sdf)
│
├── 🏊 Pool Overview (when expanded)
│   └── Pool "sdf": 30 total capacity, shared between categories
│
├── 📄 Contracts
│   └── Ticket sdfsdf (1 allocation)
│
└── 💰 Rates
    └── Main Grandstand rate (linked to pool "sdf")
```

- Clear visual relationship between item, categories, and pools

### **3. Logical Workflow**
- View item → Manage its allocations → See its pools → Track capacity
- All in one cohesive view

### **4. Lightweight Interface**
- Only shows allocation management when needed
- Expands inline without leaving the page
- Easy to close and return to normal view
