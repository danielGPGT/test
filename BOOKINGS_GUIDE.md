# Bookings Guide

## Overview

The Bookings feature allows you to sell rooms and see immediate impacts on inventory. When you create a booking, the listing's `sold` count increases and `available` inventory decreases automatically.

## How It Works

### Real-Time Inventory Updates

```
Before Booking:
Listing: 80 total rooms, 33 sold, 47 available

Create Booking: 2 rooms

After Booking:
Listing: 80 total rooms, 35 sold, 45 available ‚Üê Updated instantly!
```

### The Booking Flow

1. **Select a Tour**
   - Choose which tour the customer is booking
   - System shows tour dates and description

2. **Choose Room Type & Occupancy**
   - **Only listings with available inventory are shown**
   - Displays: Room type, occupancy, price, available count
   - Shows listing details (contract, type, etc.)

3. **Enter Quantity**
   - How many rooms to book
   - System validates against available inventory
   - Can't exceed available rooms

4. **Customer Information**
   - Customer name
   - Customer email

5. **Confirm Booking**
   - System calculates total price
   - Creates booking record
   - **Updates listing's sold count**
   - Shows success confirmation

## Features

### Availability Validation

The system prevents overbooking:
```typescript
Available rooms: 47
Trying to book: 50
Result: ‚ùå "Only 47 rooms available!"
```

### Real-Time Statistics

The bookings page shows:
- **Total Bookings**: Count of confirmed bookings
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all confirmed booking prices
- **Rooms Booked**: Total rooms sold across all bookings

### Booking Status

Each booking has a status:
- **Confirmed** ‚úÖ (green badge): Active booking, inventory allocated
- **Pending** üü° (yellow badge): Awaiting confirmation
- **Cancelled** ‚ùå (red badge): Booking cancelled, inventory returned

### Cancellations

You can cancel bookings:
1. Click "View" actions on a booking
2. Confirm cancellation
3. **Rooms are returned to inventory** (sold count decreases)
4. Booking status changed to "cancelled"

```
Before Cancel:
Listing: 80 total, 35 sold, 45 available

Cancel Booking: 2 rooms

After Cancel:
Listing: 80 total, 33 sold, 47 available ‚Üê Rooms returned!
```
