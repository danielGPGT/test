# ✅ System Refactor Complete

## 🎯 **Goal: Simplified Tour Operator Workflow**

We've successfully refactored the system to eliminate overcomplicated flows and reduce the number of entities tour operators need to manage.

---

## 📋 **What Changed**

### **1. Stock Entity Merged into Contract** ✅
**Before:**
```
Contract → Stock → Listing → Booking
(4 steps to manage inventory)
```

**After:**
```
Contract (with room_allocations) → Listing → Booking
(3 steps - simpler!)
```

**Contract now includes:**
- `room_allocations: Array<{ room_group_id: string, quantity: number }>`
- Direct room allocation without separate Stock entity

---

### **2. Auto-Generated Rates** ✅
**Before:**
- Manually create rates for each:
  - Room type
  - Occupancy type
  - Board type
- Example: 2 rooms × 3 occupancies × 2 boards = **12 manual entries**

**After:**
- Contract auto-generates all rates when saved
- Just configure once in contract:
  - Pricing strategy (per_occupancy or flat_rate)
  - Occupancy rates (single: £80, double: £100, triple: £115)
  - Board options
  - Room allocations
- System creates **12 rates automatically** ✨

---

### **3. Multi-Occupancy Pricing Strategy** ✅
**Flexible Contract Configuration:**

#### **Option A: Per-Occupancy Pricing**
```
Contract specifies different rates for different occupancies:
- Single (1p): £80/night
- Double (2p): £100/night
- Triple (3p): £115/night

System auto-generates separate rates for each.
```

#### **Option B: Flat Rate Pricing**
```
Contract has one rate regardless of occupancy:
- Any occupancy: £100/night

System auto-generates only double occupancy (standard).
```

---

### **4. Markup Settings at Rate Level** ✅
**Before:**
- Markup at Listing level (confusing)

**After:**
- Markup at Rate level (inherited from Contract)
- `markup_percentage: 60%` (regular nights)
- `shoulder_markup_percentage: 30%` (shoulder nights)
- Each rate can override contract defaults

---

### **5. Streamlined Listing** ✅
**Before:**
```typescript
{
  tour_id,
  stock_id,      // Removed
  quantity,      // Removed
  cost_price,    // Removed
  selling_price, // Removed
  markup,        // Moved to Rate
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{
  tour_id,
  contract_id,   // Direct link to contract
  room_group_id, // Which room type
  purchase_type, // 'inventory' or 'buy_to_order'
}
```

**Much simpler!** Listing is now just a link between Tour and Contract.

---

### **6. Buy-to-Order Support** ✅
**For ad-hoc/flexible bookings without pre-allocated inventory:**

- Rates can be created without a contract (`hotel_id` instead of `contract_id`)
- `estimated_costs: true` flag
- Still supports all pricing features
- Always shows as "available" (no stock limits)

---

## 🔄 **New Workflow**

### **Creating Inventory-Based Tours**
```
1. Create/Select Hotel
   ├─ Add room groups (Standard Double, Deluxe Suite, etc.)
   
2. Create Contract
   ├─ Set pricing strategy (per_occupancy or flat_rate)
   ├─ Enter occupancy rates (if per_occupancy)
   │  • Single: £80
   │  • Double: £100
   │  • Triple: £115
   ├─ Add board options
   │  • Room Only: £0
   │  • Bed & Breakfast: £15/person/night
   ├─ Add room allocations
   │  • 60× Standard Double
   │  • 40× Deluxe Suite
   ├─ Set markup (60% regular, 30% shoulder)
   
   ✨ SYSTEM AUTO-GENERATES:
      60 × 3 occupancies × 2 boards = 360 rates!
   
3. Create Listing
   ├─ Select tour
   ├─ Select contract
   ├─ Select room type
   ├─ Purchase type: "inventory"
   
   ✅ Done! Ready to book.
```

### **Creating Buy-to-Order Tours**
```
1. Create/Select Hotel
   
2. Create Listing
   ├─ Select tour
   ├─ Purchase type: "buy_to_order"
   ├─ Select hotel
   ├─ Select room type
   
3. Create Ad-hoc Rate (in Inventory Setup)
   ├─ Select hotel (no contract)
   ├─ Enter estimated costs
   │  • Base rate
   │  • Board cost
   │  • Taxes, fees
   ├─ Set markup
   
   ✅ Done! Can book immediately.
```

## 📊 **Data Structure**

### **Contract Interface**
```typescript
interface Contract {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // NEW: Room allocations (merged from Stock)
  room_allocations?: Array<{
    room_group_id: string
    quantity: number
  }>
  
  // NEW: Occupancy pricing
  pricing_strategy?: 'per_occupancy' | 'flat_rate'
  occupancy_rates?: Array<{
    occupancy_type: 'single' | 'double' | 'triple' | 'quad'
    rate: number
  }>
  
  // NEW: Markup settings
  markup_percentage?: number // default 0.60 (60%)
  shoulder_markup_percentage?: number // default 0.30 (30%)
}
```

### **Rate Interface**
```typescript
interface Rate {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // NEW: Markup (inherited from contract)
  markup_percentage?: number
  shoulder_markup_percentage?: number
  
  // NEW: For buy-to-order rates
  hotel_id?: number // Instead of contract_id
  estimated_costs?: boolean
}
```

### **Listing Interface (Simplified)**
```typescript
interface Listing {
  tour_id: number
  contract_id?: number // For inventory
  hotel_id?: number // For buy-to-order
  room_group_id: string
  purchase_type: 'inventory' | 'buy_to_order'
  
  // DEPRECATED (for backward compatibility):
  stock_id?, quantity?, cost_price?, selling_price?, markup?
}
```

## 🗑️ **Deprecated/Removed**

### **Stock Entity**
- ❌ Separate Stock entity removed
- ✅ Merged into `Contract.room_allocations`
- Functions still exist but log warnings

### **Markup in Listings**
- ❌ Removed from Listing
- ✅ Moved to Rate level (better control)

---

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Fewer Steps:** Contract → Listing → Booking (was 4 steps, now 3)
2. **Auto-Generation:** Create 1 contract, get hundreds of rates automatically
3. **Less Duplication:** No more manual entry of same data across entities
4. **Flexibility:** Supports both per-occupancy and flat-rate contracts
5. **Buy-to-Order:** Full support for ad-hoc bookings without inventory
6. **Better UX:** Everything in one consolidated page
7. **Clearer Pricing:** Markup and costs at the right level (Rate, not Listing)

---

## 📝 **Migration Notes**

### **Existing Data**
- Old Stock records: Ignored (empty array)
- Old Listings: Still work (backward compatible)
- Old Rates: Still work, just need markup fields added

### **New Contracts**
- Must include `room_allocations` for auto-generation
- Must set `pricing_strategy` and `occupancy_rates`
- Will auto-generate all rates when saved
