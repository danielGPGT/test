# Session Summary: Unified Inventory Management System

## 🎉 **Major Achievement: Complete Inventory System Unification**

This session transformed your application from fragmented inventory pages into a **unified, enterprise-grade inventory management system** with consistent UX/UI across all inventory types.

---

## 📋 **What Was Accomplished**

### **1. Unified Inventory Management Page** ✅
- **Created**: Single page with dynamic tab navigation
- **Tabs**: Hotels + each service inventory type (auto-generated)
- **Navigation**: One entry point for all inventory management
- **File**: `src/pages/inventory-management.tsx`

**Before:**
```
├── Inventory Setup (Hotels only)
└── Service Inventory (Services only)
```

**After:**
```
Inventory Management
├── [🏨 Hotels] [🎫 F1 Tickets] [🚗 Transfers] [...]
└── Dynamic tabs auto-generated from service types
```

---

### **2. Hotels Page Redesign** ✅
- **Completely refactored** `src/pages/inventory-setup.tsx`
- **New structure**: Tour-based grouping (matching services)
- **Accordion organization**: Tours → Hotels → Contracts → Rates
- **Unified rates table**: ALL rates visible at once (no accordion drilling)
- **Compact contract cards**: Edit, clone, delete, add rates
- **Filters**: Tour, Supplier, Status, Search
- **Generic section**: Non-tour-specific contracts at top

**1,600+ lines** of modern, clean code

---

### **3. Buy-to-Order Hotel Rates** ✅
- **Restored** full buy-to-order functionality
- **Button added**: "Buy-to-Order Rate" on each hotel
- **Comprehensive form**: All cost fields (tax, fees, commission, board)
- **Live preview**: Real-time price calculation
- **Visibility fixed**: Now properly shown in unified rates table
- **Tour association**: Buy-to-order rates can be tour-specific

---

### **4. Tour Association for Rates** ✅
- **Added** `tour_id` and `tourName` to Rate interface
- **Dropdown**: "Link to Tour" in rate form
- **Smart defaults**: Pre-fills based on context
- **Flexible**: Override contract tour or create generic rates
- **Filtering**: Rates properly filtered by tour

---

### **5. Shoulder Rates Refactor** ✅
- **NEW ARCHITECTURE**: Shoulder nights as separate Rate entities
- **Added fields**:
  - `is_shoulder: boolean`
  - `shoulder_type: 'none' | 'pre' | 'post'`
  - `linked_main_rate_id: number` (optional)
- **Dropdown selector**: Choose shoulder type in rate form
- **Visual badges**: Blue for pre-shoulder, purple for post-shoulder
- **Enterprise flexibility**: Each shoulder period fully customizable
- **Backward compatible**: Legacy arrays still work

---

### **6. Unified Rates Display** ✅
- **Single table** showing ALL rates (contract + buy-to-order + shoulder)
- **Source column**: Shows contract name or "Buy-to-Order"
- **Shoulder badges**: Visual indicators for pre/post shoulder
- **No accordion drilling**: See everything at once
- **Consistent across** generic and tour sections
