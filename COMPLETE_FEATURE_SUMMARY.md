  │  ├─ Can override: any field
  │  └─ Priority: ALWAYS shown first
  │
  └─ Buy-to-Order Rates (Fallback)
     ├─ Required: valid_from, valid_to, min_nights, max_nights
     ├─ Must set: all taxes, fees, pricing
     └─ Shows ONLY when: no inventory for that room type

Booking Availability:
  ├─ Date check: booking within rate validity
  ├─ Night check: booking nights between min/max
  ├─ Inventory check: rooms available
  └─ Filter check: matches user filters

Pricing:
  ├─ Base rate × nights
  ├─ Board cost × nights
  ├─ Commission (on base only)
  ├─ Fees × nights
  ├─ VAT on subtotal
  ├─ City tax × people × nights
