# 🔧 **Category Filtering Fix**

## **The Problem You Identified**

The category overview was showing **ALL categories** for the item, even if they weren't part of the selected pool:

```
❌ BEFORE (WRONG):
📋 Categories Overview
- Standard Double Room (not in pool)
- Standard Twin Room (not in pool)  
- Suite (not in pool)
- Presidential Suite (not in pool)
```

---

## **🎯 What We Fixed**

### **1. Pool-Specific Category Filtering**
- **Before**: Showed all categories for the item
- **After**: Only shows categories that are actually allocated in the selected pool

### **2. Smart Category Detection**
- Scans all contracts to find which categories are actually allocated
- Filters by the selected pool ID
- Only displays relevant categories

### **3. Visual Improvements**
- Added pool ID badge in the header
- Clear indication of which pool is being viewed

---

## **🔧 How It Works Now**

### **When you click "Categories" on a pool:**

1. **Scans contracts** for allocations using that specific pool ID
2. **Identifies categories** that are allocated in those contracts
3. **Filters the display** to only show relevant categories
4. **Shows pool context** in the header

### **Example:**
```
Click "Categories" on pool "dfg"
↓
Only shows:
- Standard Double Room (allocated in pool "dfg")
- Standard Twin Room (allocated in pool "dfg")
↓
Does NOT show:
- Suite (not allocated in pool "dfg")
- Presidential Suite (not allocated in pool "dfg")
```

## **🎯 What You'll See Now**

```
📋 Categories Overview

### **No More Irrelevant Categories:**
