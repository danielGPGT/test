# ✅ Unified Rate Form MTWTFSS - FIXED!

## 🎯 Issue Found and Fixed!

**Problem**: The day-of-week selector in the unified inventory rate form was **hidden inside a conditional block** that only showed for hotels or when min_nights was defined.

**Result**: ✅ **FIXED!** Day-of-week selector now shows for **ALL inventory types**.

---

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

### **Before (Broken):**
```tsx
{/* Min/Max Nights (Hotels and applicable services) */}
{(item.item_type === 'hotel' || formData.min_nights !== undefined) && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3">
      {/* Min/Max Nights fields */}
    </div>

    {/* Days of Week Selector - HIDDEN HERE! */}
    <div className="grid gap-2">
      <DayOfWeekSelector ... />
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Problem**: The day-of-week selector was **inside** the conditional block, so it only showed for:
- Hotels (item.item_type === 'hotel')
- OR when min_nights was already defined

**Missing for**: Transfers, tickets, activities, services, etc.

## ✅ What's Fixed

### **After (Fixed):**
```tsx
{/* Min/Max Nights (Hotels and applicable services) */}
{(item.item_type === 'hotel' || formData.min_nights !== undefined) && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3">
      {/* Min/Max Nights fields */}
    </div>
  </div>
)}

{/* Days of Week Selector - Available for ALL inventory types */}
<div className="grid gap-2">
  <DayOfWeekSelector
    value={recordToDaySelection(formData.days_of_week)}
    onChange={(selection) => updateField('days_of_week', daySelectionToRecord(selection))}
    label="Valid Days of Week"
  />
  <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
    Select which days of the week this rate is valid for. All days are selected by default.
  </p>
</div>
```

**Fixed**: Day-of-week selector is now **outside** the conditional block, so it shows for **ALL inventory types**.
