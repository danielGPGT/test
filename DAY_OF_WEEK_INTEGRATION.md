# ✅ Day of Week Selector - Fully Integrated!

## 🎉 Integration Complete!

The **M,T,W,T,F,S,S** day of week selector is now fully integrated into both contract and rate forms!

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added imports for `DayOfWeekSelector` and helper functions
- ✅ Added `<DayOfWeekSelector />` component in the "Booking Constraints" section
- ✅ Positioned after Min/Max Nights fields

- ✅ Zero linting errors

**Location:**
The day selector appears in the contract form's **"Booking Constraints"** accordion section (for hotels), after the Min Nights and Max Nights fields.

### ✅ 3. Rate Form Integration

**File:** `src/components/unified-inventory/forms/unified-rate-form-enhanced.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added imports for `DayOfWeekSelector` and helper functions
- ✅ Added `days_of_week` to formData initialization

## 🔍 How It Works

### **Data Flow:**

1. **Load existing data:**
   ```typescript
   // Contract has: days_of_week: { monday: true, tuesday: false, ... }
   // Convert to DayOfWeekSelection for UI
   const daySelection = recordToDaySelection(formData.days_of_week)
   ```

2. **User interacts with selector:**
   ```typescript
   // User clicks days, changes selection
   <DayOfWeekSelector
     value={daySelection}
     onChange={(selection) => ...}
   />
   ```

3. **Save to form data:**
   ```typescript
   // Convert DayOfWeekSelection back to Record format
   updateField('days_of_week', daySelectionToRecord(selection))
   ```

4. **Stored in database:**
   ```typescript
   // Saved as: { monday: true, tuesday: true, wednesday: false, ... }
   ```

### **Default Behavior:**

If `days_of_week` is `undefined` or `null`:
- **All days are selected by default** (M,T,W,T,F,S,S all checked)
- This maintains backward compatibility
- Existing contracts without `days_of_week` remain valid all days

## 🎯 Integration Points

### **Contract Form:**
- **Section**: Booking Constraints (Accordion)
- **Visibility**: Only shown for hotels
- **Position**: After Min/Max Nights
- **Default**: All days selected

### **Rate Form:**
- **Section**: Min/Max Nights area
- **Visibility**: Same as Min/Max Nights (hotels + applicable services)
- **Position**: After Min/Max Nights inputs
- **Default**: Inherits from contract, or all days if not set

```typescript
export interface DayOfWeekSelection {
  monday: boolean
  tuesday: boolean

### **Helper Functions:**

recordToDaySelection(record?: Record<string, boolean>): DayOfWeekSelection

// Convert Selection to Record (for storage)
daySelectionToRecord(selection: DayOfWeekSelection): Record<string, boolean>
