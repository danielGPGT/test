# System Improvements

## ✨ Major Enhancements Added

### 1. 💾 **LocalStorage Persistence**

**Problem:** Data disappeared on page refresh

**Solution:** All data now persists in browser localStorage

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Data survives page refresh
- ✅ Test data persists between sessions
- ✅ No need to recreate test data
- ✅ Falls back to initial data if localStorage fails

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Auto-loads from localStorage on mount
tours: loadFromStorage('tours-inventory-tours', initialData.tours)

// Auto-saves on every change
setTours([...newTours]) → Saved to localStorage instantly
```

**Storage Keys:**
- `tours-inventory-tours`
- `tours-inventory-hotels`
- `tours-inventory-contracts`
- `tours-inventory-rates`
- `tours-inventory-listings`
- `tours-inventory-bookings`

**Reset Data:**
User Menu → "Reset All Data" to clear and restore defaults

### 2. 🎉 **Toast Notifications**

**Problem:** Browser alerts were ugly and disruptive

**Solution:** Beautiful toast notifications with Sonner

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Stack multiple toasts
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Better UX

**Location:** Top-right corner of screen

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
import { toast } from 'sonner'

// Success
toast.success('Booking created successfully!')

// Info
toast.info('Data saved to localStorage')
```

**Currently Used:**
