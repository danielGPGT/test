# 🎯 **Pools Integrated Inline Between Contracts & Rates**

## **What We Accomplished**

You wanted pools displayed inline between contracts and rates, with the same sleek UI style. We've now integrated pools directly into each inventory item's flow, showing them between contracts and rates sections.

## **🎯 How It Works Now**

### **Item Flow:**
```
🎫 F1 Abu Dhabi Tickets
├── 📄 Contracts (1)
│   └── Ticket sdfsdf
│
├── 📦 Pools (1)          ← NEW SECTION
│   └── Pool "sdf": 30 capacity, 0 booked, healthy
│
└── 💰 Rates (1)
    └── Main Grandstand rate (linked to pool "sdf")
```

### **What You'll See:**
- **Pool ID**: "sdf"
- **Status**: "healthy" (with color-coded badge)
- **Capacity**: "0 / 30 booked"
- **Availability**: "30 available"
- **Utilization**: "0.0% utilized"
