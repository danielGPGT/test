# 📍 Where is My Contract? Quick Guide

## ✅ Your Contract WAS Created!

Console shows: `✅ Created ticket contract: sdfsdf`

**It's just in a different section!**

---

## 🗺️ **How Contracts Are Organized**

Contracts appear in **different sections** based on tour linking:

### **1. Generic Section** (No Tour Linked)
```
▼ Generic Inventory (No Tour)
  
  Contracts with: tour_ids = [] or undefined
  These can be used across ALL tours
```

### **2. Tour-Specific Sections**
```
▼ Abu Dhabi F1 GP 2025
  
  Contracts with: tour_ids = [3]  ← Your contract is HERE!
  These are for THIS tour only
```

---

## 🎯 **Your Contract Location**

**Your contract data:**
```javascript
tour_ids: [3]  ← Tour ID 3
```

**So it's in:** The accordion section for Tour ID 3!

---

## 🔍 **How to Find It (After Refresh)**

### **Step 1: Refresh Page**
Press **F5**

### **Step 2: Look for Tour Sections**
Scroll down past "Generic Inventory"

You'll see accordion sections like:
```
▼ Tour Name Here          ← WILL BE AUTO-EXPANDED NOW!
  Date range • X contracts • X rates
```

### **Step 3: Find Your Tour**
Look for **tour_id: 3** - check which tour that is in your tours list

**The accordion will be ALREADY OPEN** (auto-expands if has contracts!)

### **Step 4: Find Your Item**
Inside that tour section, find your inventory item

### **Step 5: See Your Contract!**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 💡 **Pro Tip: Create Generic Contracts**

**To make contracts appear in Generic section:**

When creating a contract, **DON'T check any tours** in the "Link to Tours" section!

```
Link to Tours (Optional)
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ □ Abu Dhabi F1 GP 2025      │ ← Leave UNCHECKED!
│ □ Monaco GP 2025            │ ← Leave UNCHECKED!
│ □ Singapore GP 2025         │ ← Leave UNCHECKED!
│                             │
│ 💡 Leave empty to make this │
│    contract available for   │
│    all tours                │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** Contract appears in **Generic Inventory** section (reusable!)

## 🔄 **What Changed (Just Now)**

I fixed 3 things:

### **Fix 1: Auto-Expand Tour Sections** ✅
- Tour sections with contracts/rates **auto-open**
- No more hidden contracts!

### **Fix 2: Better Toast Messages** ✅
```
Before: "Contract created!"
After:  "✅ Contract created! Look in: Abu Dhabi F1 GP 2025"
```
Now tells you exactly where to look!

### **Fix 3: Supplier Auto-Selection** ✅
- Supplier field now **auto-selects** first active supplier
- No more validation errors from supplier_id: 0

---

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

**Create a contract and watch the toast:**

1. Click `[New Contract]`
2. Fill in details
3. **Link to a tour** (check a checkbox)
4. Save
5. **Toast says:** "✅ Contract created! Look in: [Tour Name]"
6. **That tour section auto-opens!**
7. **Your contract is visible immediately!**

---

## 📊 **Decision: Generic vs Tour-Specific**

### **Use Generic Contracts When:**
- ✅ Contract can be used across multiple tours
- ✅ Flexible inventory (not event-specific)
- ✅ Want to reuse rates for different tours
- ✅ Example: Hotels, standard transfers

### **Use Tour-Specific Contracts When:**
- ✅ Contract is for ONE specific event
- ✅ Limited time availability
- ✅ Event-specific pricing
- ✅ Example: F1 weekend tickets, event shuttles

---

## 🚀 **Try Again Now**

1. **Refresh page** (F5)
2. **Create contract** for your NH City hotel
3. **Either:**
   - Leave tours unchecked → Goes to Generic section
   - Check a tour → Goes to that tour's section
4. **Watch the toast message** → Tells you where it went!
5. **That section auto-opens** → See your contract immediately!

---

## ✅ **Your Contract IS There!**

**To find your existing "sdfsdf" contract:**

1. Look for tour with ID: 3 in your tours list
2. Find that tour's accordion section
3. Should be AUTO-EXPANDED now
4. Your contract is inside!

**Or:** 

Check console to see which tour:
```javascript
const tours = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tours-inventory-tours'))
tours.find(t => t.id === 3)
// Shows which tour has ID 3
```

---

## 🎊 **Summary**

**Contract creation works!** It just goes to different sections based on tour linking:

- **No tours checked** → Generic section
- **Tours checked** → Those tour sections (auto-expanded!)

**Refresh and you'll see it!** 🚀
