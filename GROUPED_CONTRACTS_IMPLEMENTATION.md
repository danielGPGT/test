# Grouped Contract Selection - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We Implemented

We've successfully implemented **Option 2: Grouped with Manual Contract Selection** for your internal sales team booking system.

### The Problem We Solved

When you have multiple contracts for the same room type (e.g., same hotel, same room), the booking interface was showing duplicate-looking options:
- ❌ Hilton - Standard Double (Contract A)
- ❌ Hilton - Standard Double (Contract B)  
- ❌ Hilton - Standard Double (Contract C)

This created confusion and cluttered UI.

### The Solution

Now the system **groups identical room types** and presents all contract options in a clean, organized interface.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Smart Grouping**
- Rooms are grouped by Hotel + Room Type
- Shows total availability across all contracts
- One card per unique room type

### 2. **Contract Comparison**
Each contract option shows:
- ✅ **Cost per room** (what you pay)
- ✅ **Sell price** (what client pays) - calculated with 60% markup
- ✅ **Margin** (your profit in € and %)
- ✅ **Available quantity**
- ✅ **Board type** (B&B, Half Board, etc.)
- ✅ **Commission rate** (if applicable)

### 3. **Smart Badges**
- ⭐ **Best Margin** - Automatically highlights the contract with highest profit
- 💰 **Lowest Cost** - Shows the cheapest option

### 4. **Full Transparency**
Sales teams can see:
- All available contracts side-by-side
- Real-time pricing calculations
- Availability for each contract
- Business metrics (cost, sell, margin)

### 5. **Sales Team Control**
- **Manual selection** - Sales team chooses which contract to use
- **Business reasons** - Can prioritize specific contracts for strategic reasons
- **Client-specific** - Can select premium contracts for VIP clients

---

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Grouping Logic
```typescript
const groupedRates = useMemo(() => {
  // Group by: hotel + room_group_id
  const key = `${hotel.id}-${rate.room_group_id}`
  
  // Aggregate:
  // - All rates for this room type
  // - Total availability across contracts
  // - Min price, max margin
  
  // Sort by: hotel name, then room name
}, [availableRates, nights])
```

### Price Calculations
For each contract option:
```typescript
Cost per room = (Base rate + Board cost + Fees + Taxes) × nights
Sell per room = Cost per room × 1.60  (60% markup)
Margin = Sell - Cost
Margin % = (Margin / Cost) × 100
```

### Component Structure
```
GroupedRateCard
├── Card Header (Room name, total availability)
├── Contract Options List
│   ├── Contract A (selectable button)
│   ├── Contract B (selectable button)
│   └── Contract C (selectable button)
├── Occupancy & Quantity Controls
├── Price Summary
└── Add to Cart Button
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Markup Percentage
Currently set to **60% markup** (hard-coded):
```typescript

```

**Future Enhancement**: Make this configurable per:
- Contract
- Rate
- Room type
- Season (regular vs shoulder nights)
- Client tier (standard vs VIP)

### Sorting
Default sort order:
1. **Best Margin First** (highest profit)
2. Can be extended to allow:
   - Lowest Cost
   - Most Available
   - Contract Name

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Filtering
- Filter by margin threshold
- Filter by availability count
- Filter by commission rate

### 2. Contract Warnings
```typescript
⚠️ Contract B: 15 rooms remaining to meet minimum (20/35)
ℹ️ Contract A: Recommended - Best margin
✓ Contract C: No commitments
```

### 3. Mixed Bookings
Allow booking from multiple contracts in one booking:
```
Room 1-3: Contract A (best margin)
Room 4-5: Contract C (overflow capacity)
```

### 4. Performance Metrics
Show in each contract option:
- Usage this month
- Average booking size
- Client satisfaction rating

### 5. Smart Recommendations
```
💡 Recommended: Contract A
   ✓ Best margin (€54/room)
   ✓ Flexible cancellation
   ✓ 5 rooms available

```
